# CHokiMod

A continuation of HzMod, built for ChokiStream.

A utility background process for the Nintendo 3DS, purpose-built for screen-streaming over WiFi. Name is derived from "ChokiStream", and "HzMod" which itself is derived from "HorizonM"

## Getting started

Please note, the HorizonScreen application in this repository is old and obsolete. We recommend using [ChokiStream](https://github.com/Eiim/Chokistream), but it may also work with Snickerstream and/or other old versions of HorizonScreen.
